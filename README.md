# cv-chess

This project is focused on creating a general chess playing robot.
The benefit this project has over others is that it does utilize any specific board sensors, it uses soly computer vision to establish to chess board.
Subsequently, moves are detected via opencv and moves are made using inverse kinematics.

note: a precise robotic arm is required
